7. [Lab 7: Optional Team Adoption Module](#lab-7-optional-team-adoption-module)

## Prerequisites

- Gemini CLI installed: `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli` (version 0.37.x or later)
- API key set: `export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-key"`
- Git installed and configured
- Development environment for Python, JavaScript, or Java
- Docker (optional, for sandbox mode)

## Heads-up: Plan Mode is the default

As of Gemini CLI 0.34, `plan` is the default approval mode. When you launch
`gemini`, it will **draft a plan before executing any tool calls**. For most
of these labs you'll want to accept the plan (press `Shift+Tab` to cycle
modes, or accept each step) before commands run. If a step feels "stuck,"
check whether Gemini is waiting for plan approval.

To skip plan mode entirely for a lab step:

```bash
gemini --approval-mode default       # per-tool approval
gemini --approval-mode auto_edit     # auto-approve edits
```

Also note the keyboard shortcut change in 0.37: **`Ctrl+G`** opens the
external editor (it used to be `Ctrl+X`).

## Lab 1: Getting Started and Project Creation

**Duration**: 25 minutes

**Goal**: Get comfortable with Gemini CLI while building a task manager application from scratch

### Setup

1. Create a new empty directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir my-task-manager && cd my-task-manager
   ```

2. Initialize git:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

3. Start Gemini CLI:
   ```bash
   gemini
   ```

### Exercises

1. **Explore the interface**:
   ```
   What are your main capabilities for helping with development?
   ```

   Then explore the available commands:
   ```
   /help
   ```
   Review the slash commands before diving in.

2. **Project foundation**:
   ```
   Create a Node.js task manager application with:
   - A Task class with id, title, description, status, and dueDate
   - Functions to add, remove, update, and list tasks
   - JSON file storage for persistence
   - A simple CLI interface using readline
   ```

3. **Check your work with shell integration**:
   ```
   !ls -la
   ```
   Use shell commands to see what Gemini created. Observe how the output is displayed.

4. **Enhanced functionality** *(Stretch Goal - if time permits)*:
   ```
   Add these features to the task manager:
   - Filter tasks by status (pending, in-progress, completed)
   - Sort tasks by due date
   - Search tasks by title or description
   - Colored console output for different statuses
   ```

5. **Check context and memory**:
   ```
   /memory show
   ```
   See what context Gemini has loaded about your project.

6. **Testing**:
   ```
   Create comprehensive tests for the task manager using Jest:
   - Unit tests for all Task class methods
   - Integration tests for file persistence
   - Edge cases like empty lists, invalid inputs
   ```

7. **Documentation**:
   ```
   Create a README.md with:
   - Project description and features
   - Installation instructions
   - Usage examples with sample output
   - API documentation for developers
   ```

8. **Keyboard shortcuts**:
   Before moving to git, try these shortcuts:
   - `Ctrl+L` to clear the screen
   - `Ctrl+Y` to toggle YOLO mode (observe the indicator change)
   - `Ctrl+Y` again to toggle back to default mode

9. **Git workflow**:
   ```
   Help me create a proper commit history:
   1. Commit the initial project structure
   2. Create a feature branch for "priority-levels"
   3. Add priority (low, medium, high) to tasks
   4. Create a commit message following conventional commits
   ```

### Expected Outcomes

- Understand Gemini CLI's conversational interface
- Know essential slash commands and keyboard shortcuts
- Build a functional application from scratch
- Experience iterative development with AI assistance
- Practice the full development cycle: concept → code → tests → docs
- Be comfortable with shell integration

## Lab 5: Configuration and Safety

**Duration**: 20 minutes

**Goal**: Configure Gemini CLI for safe, efficient workflows

### Setup

Create a test project for experimenting with configuration:
```bash
mkdir config-test && cd config-test
git init
echo "# Config Test" > README.md
```

### Exercises

1. **Explore settings**:
   ```
   /settings
   ```
   Review the current settings interface.

2. **Create project settings**:
   ```
   Create a .gemini/settings.json file with:
   - Use the current nested schema sections (general/ui/tools)
   - Vim mode enabled
   - Checkpointing enabled
   - Sandbox mode disabled
   - Hide tips set to true
   ```

3. **Tool restrictions**:
   ```
   Update settings.json to:
   - Exclude the run_shell_command tool for safety
   - Use tools.allowed to only allow read_file, write_file, and glob tools
   ```

4. **Test sandbox mode**:
   ```bash
   # Start in sandbox mode
   gemini --sandbox
   ```

   Then try:
   ```
   Create a file called test.txt with "Hello World"
   ```
   Observe how sandbox mode affects file operations.

5. **Checkpointing practice**:

   Enable checkpointing in settings, then:
   ```
   Create a complex file structure:
   - src/index.js with a basic Express server
   - src/routes/api.js with sample routes
   - package.json with dependencies
   ```

   Then:
   ```
   /restore
   ```
   View available checkpoints.

6. **Approval modes**:
   ```bash
   # Try different approval modes
   gemini --approval-mode auto_edit
   ```

   Request a file edit and observe auto-approval behavior.

   ```bash
   # Compare with YOLO mode
   gemini --approval-mode yolo
   ```

   Try creating files and observe the difference.

7. **Environment variables**:
   ```
   Create a .gemini/.env file with:
   GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash

   Then restart Gemini and verify the model change.
   ```

## Lab 6: Advanced Features

**Duration**: 30 minutes

**Goal**: Master MCP servers, extensions, custom commands, and session management

### Part A: Session Management (5 minutes)

1. **Create a session**:
   Start an interactive session and do some work:
   ```
   gemini
   > Create a simple Python calculator module with add, subtract, multiply, divide
   > Add error handling for division by zero
   > Create tests for the calculator
   ```
   Exit with `Ctrl+D`

2. **List sessions**:
   ```bash
   gemini --list-sessions
   ```

3. **Resume session**:
   ```bash
   gemini --resume
   ```
   Continue where you left off:
   ```
   Add a power function to the calculator and update the tests
   ```

4. **Session browser and rewind**:
   In interactive mode, run:
   ```
   /resume
   /rewind
   ```
   Review what each workflow enables and when you'd prefer one over the other.

### Part B: Custom Commands (10 minutes)

5. **Create a review command**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.gemini/commands
   ```

   Then create the file `~/.gemini/commands/review.toml` with:
   ```toml
   description = "Review code for security, performance, and best practices"

   prompt = """
   Review the provided code for:
   - Security vulnerabilities (injection, credentials, validation)
   - Performance issues (inefficient algorithms, resource leaks)
   - Best practices and code quality

   Provide findings with severity levels:
   - CRITICAL: Must fix before deployment
   - WARNING: Should fix soon
   - INFO: Consider improving

   {{args}}
   """
   ```

6. **Test the custom command**:
   In a new session, create a file to review:
   ```
   Create a file called sample.py with some intentionally problematic code:
   - SQL injection vulnerability
   - Hardcoded credentials
   - Inefficient loop
   ```

   Then use your command:
   ```
   /review @./sample.py
   ```

7. **Create a docs command**:
   Create the file `~/.gemini/commands/docs.toml` with:
   ```toml
   description = "Generate documentation for code"

   prompt = """
   Generate comprehensive documentation for the provided code:
   - Function signatures with parameters and return types
   - Usage examples
   - Markdown format suitable for a README

   {{args}}
   """
   ```

### Part C: MCP Server Integration (10 minutes)

8. **List available MCP servers**:
   ```bash
   gemini mcp list
   ```

9.  **Configure Firecrawl MCP**:

    ```

    Help me configure the Firecrawl MCP server in .gemini/settings.json:

    - Use the @modelcontextprotocol/server-firecrawl package

    - Set up my FIRECRAWL_API_KEY from environment

    - Ensure it allows scraping web content

    ```



10.  **Test MCP integration**:

    If configured:

    ```

    Use the Firecrawl MCP to search for "latest features of Gemini 3 Pro" and summarize the findings.

    ```

11. **Explore MCP tools**:
    ```
    What MCP tools are available in this session?
    Show me an example of using one of them.
    ```

12. **Prompt quality booster**:
    ```
    /prompt-suggest
    ```
    Ask Gemini for 3 stronger variants of your last MCP prompt and compare the results.

### Part D: Output Formats (5 minutes)

13. **JSON output for scripting**:
    ```bash
    gemini -o json "List the files in current directory and describe each"
    ```

    Observe the structured output format.

14. **Stream JSON**:
    ```bash
    gemini -o stream-json "Explain the concept of microservices architecture"
    ```

    Watch the real-time streaming output.

15. **Piped workflows**:
    ```bash
    echo "What are the top 5 Python web frameworks?" | gemini -o json
    ```

### Part E: Extensions (optional, 5 minutes)

16. **List extensions**:
    ```bash
    gemini --list-extensions
    ```

17. **Create a simple extension**:
    ```
    Help me create a basic extension at ~/.gemini/extensions/my-tools/
    that adds a custom tool for formatting code.
    Include the gemini-extension.json configuration.
    ```

18. **Enable specific extensions**:
    ```bash
    gemini -e my-tools "Format the code in @./src/"
    ```

### Expected Outcomes

After completing this lab:
- Manage and resume sessions effectively
- Create reusable custom commands
- Configure and use MCP servers
- Use output formats for automation
- Understand the extension system

## Lab 7: Optional Team Adoption Module

**Duration**: 30-45 minutes (optional / take-home)

**Goal**: Practice production-oriented workflows for authentication strategy, governance, skills/MCP controls, and CI automation.

### Part A: Authentication Strategy (10 minutes)

1. **Compare auth options**:
   Create a short matrix in `AUTH_NOTES.md` that compares:
   - Login with Google
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY`
   - Vertex AI with ADC
   - Service account credentials for CI

   Include when each is preferred and one drawback.

2. **Validate one non-default path**:
   Choose one of these:
   - Vertex path (`GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION`)
   - API-key path (`GEMINI_API_KEY`)

   Then run:
   ```bash
   gemini --version
   gemini --list-sessions
   ```
   Confirm your environment is usable with the chosen auth setup.

### Part B: Governance and Safety Controls (10-15 minutes)

3. **Create a team-safe project settings file**:
   In `.gemini/settings.json`, configure:
   - `general.defaultApprovalMode` to `auto_edit` or `plan`
   - `tools.sandbox` enabled
   - `general.checkpointing.enabled` set to `true`

   Then create a `policy.toml` file alongside it with a `deny` rule for
   `run_shell_command` and launch Gemini with `gemini --policy policy.toml`.
   (The legacy `tools.exclude` key still works but is deprecated as of
   Gemini CLI 0.30 — the Policy Engine is the forward path.)

4. **Inspect hooks and policy behavior**:
   In interactive mode, run:
   ```
   /hooks list
   /policies list
   ```
   Ask Gemini to explain what each active control does and which risks it reduces.

### Part C: Skills + MCP Hardening (10-15 minutes)

5. **Skills lifecycle drill**:
   In interactive mode:
   ```
   /skills list
   /skills disable <one-skill-name>
   /skills enable <one-skill-name>
   ```
   Observe how discoverable skills change.

6. **MCP scoping exercise**:
   Update one MCP server in `.gemini/settings.json` to:
   - Add `includeTools` for only the tools you need
   - Add `excludeTools` for at least one sensitive tool

   Then run:
   ```bash
   gemini mcp list
   ```
   In interactive mode:
   ```
   /mcp list
   /mcp refresh
   ```

7. **MCP resource prompt practice**:
   If your MCP server exposes resources, use one URI with `@...` in a prompt and summarize what changed versus a tool-only prompt.

### Part D: CI/Automation Pattern (10 minutes)

8. **Create a repeatable automation check**:
   Add a script snippet to `automation_notes.md`:
   ```bash
   gemini -o json "Review @./src/ for security issues" > review.json
   if gemini -o json "Summarize risk level in one sentence"; then
     echo "Gemini check completed"
   else
     echo "Gemini check failed" && exit 1
   fi
   ```

9. **Post-process output**:
   Parse `review.json` with your preferred tool (`jq`, Node, Python) and extract one field for a simple pass/fail decision.

### Expected Outcomes

After completing this optional lab:
- Choose the right auth method for local, team, and CI contexts
- Apply practical governance controls with settings, hooks, and policies
- Restrict MCP/skills behavior to safer team defaults
- Build a basic non-interactive Gemini CLI automation pattern

## Tips for Success

### Effective Prompting

- **Be specific** about what you want to achieve
- **Use file references** (`@path/to/file`) for context
- **Iterate** for complex tasks - don't try everything at once
- **Provide examples** when the output format matters

### Best Practices

- Start with default approval mode, use YOLO after building trust
- Enable checkpointing before risky operations
- Keep GEMINI.md files updated with current project state
- Commit regularly to have a safety net
- Review all AI-generated code before accepting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: Gemini doesn't understand the project structure
**Solution**: Create a comprehensive GEMINI.md with architecture details

**Issue**: Generated code doesn't match project style
**Solution**: Add coding standards to your GEMINI.md

**Issue**: API rate limits
**Solution**: Use Gemini 2.5 Flash for faster, cheaper operations

**Issue**: Context not loading
**Solution**: Run `/memory refresh` and check file paths

**Issue**: MCP server not connecting
**Solution**: Check server configuration in settings.json, then use `gemini mcp list` and `/mcp refresh`

---

## Next Steps

After completing these labs:

1. **Practice daily**: Use Gemini CLI for regular development tasks
2. **Customize**: Build your personal GEMINI.md and command library
3. **Explore MCP**: Set up servers for your common tools and services
4. **Share**: Document workflows for your team
5. **Stay updated**: Follow Gemini CLI releases for new features
